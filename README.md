# 🧙‍♂️ DSLR – Data Science Linear Regression (125/100)

This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and focuses on implementing a logistic regression classifier from scratch in Python, without using machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`. The goal is to explore data analysis techniques and apply a supervised learning model to classify Hogwarts students into their respective houses.

## 📚 Project Summary

You are given a dataset of Hogwarts students, including various attributes such as flying skills, magical powers, academic results, etc. Your task is to:

- Analyze and clean the dataset
- Visualize features to identify correlations
- Implement a multiclass logistic regression model
- Train and test the model to classify students into 4 houses:
  - Gryffindor
  - Hufflepuff
  - Ravenclaw
  - Slytherin

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Logistic Regression (One-vs-All)
- 📊 Data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- 🧼 Data preprocessing (normalization, handling missing values)
- 💾 Training, testing, and evaluation
- 📈 Gradient descent optimization (batch GD, stochastic GD and Mini-batch GD)
